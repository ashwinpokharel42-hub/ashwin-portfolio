                <h2>Reflective Discussion</h2>
                <p>
                    Over the course of this module, I learned the basics of web development,
                    including HTML structure, CSS styling, as well as responsive design techniques.
                    The development of this portfolio taught me how to organize the multi-page website,
                    maintain consistent navigation, and also apply design principles such as  color schemes,
                    typography, and also the layout grids. I also encountered challenges in debugging CSS 
                    alignment issues and ensuirng that the site looked good on desktop
                    as well as mobile devices as well. Through trial and error, I learned the importance of HTML 
                    on how it is used and is used for developing websites in day to day lives. I even grasped the knowledge of it as well.

                    <p>
                        I even encountered challenges while debugging CSS alignment issues and ensuring that the site looked
                        good on both desktop as well as mobile devices. SOme layouts initially broke on the smaller screens
                        ,which  required a repeated testing as well as adjustments. Through the trial and error, I gained
                        a better understanding of how HTML elements and CSS rules interact.

                <h2>Design Decisions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Font choice: Clean, sans-serif for readability</li>
                    <li>Color scheme: Light background with contrasting text.</li>
                    <li>Layout: Consistent grid layout for Projects and resposive design.</li>
                    <li>Navigation: Simple top navigation bar linking all pages for ease of access.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Video Demonstration</h2>

                     <h2>Validation Reports</h2>
                     <p> 
                        The following screenshots show that the HTML and CSS files used in this website validate 
                        successfully using the W3C validation tools.

                            <p> Generative AI tools such as chatgpt were used in an assistive role to help explain HTML and CSS concepts
                                and support debugging. All code was written, tested and understood by me.
